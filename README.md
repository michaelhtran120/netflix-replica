# Netflix Replica

Created with Create-React-App

Create a clone of Netflix as close as possible. Utilize movie-trailer API to play a video when a movie title has been clicked since I do not have access to Netflix's library.

Also the list of movies were taken from TMDB so it does not truly reflect Netflix catalogue.

## API

Still a bit shaky using API's at this time, but getting better at handling the response and filtering the data correctly to achieve desired results in my application. 

## React

This is my first complete React project. (Other projects were smaller and very focused to accomplish a single action) Still trying to break down the best way to extract components and learning how to use hooks.
