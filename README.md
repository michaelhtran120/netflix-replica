# Netflix Replica

Created with Create-React-App

Create a clone of Netflix as close as possible. Utilize movie-trailer API to play a video when a movie title has been clicked since I do not have access to Netflix's library.

Also the list of movies were taken from TMDB so it does not truly reflect Netflix catalogue.

Utilize Firebase for backend.

## How to Use
[Live Demo](https://michaelhtran120.github.io/netflix-replica/browse)

Create a new account and password. There is no email confirmation required so you can use a fake email.

If not, go ahead and access using the following account credentials.
Username: test@test.com
Password: test123

## API

Still a bit shaky using API's at this time, but getting better at handling the response and filtering the data correctly to achieve desired results in my application. 

## React

This is my first complete React project. (Other projects were smaller and very focused to accomplish a single action) Still trying to break down the best way to extract components and learning how to use hooks. 

## Firebase

I don't have much knowledge in using Firebase. I utilized Firebase just to get an authentication feature to my application. My goal is to learn Node.js / Express to build my back end and handle authentication that way in the future.
