# Netflix Replica

Created with Create-React-App

Create a clone of Netflix as close as possible. Utilize movie-trailer API to play a video when a movie title has been clicked since I do not have access to Netflix's library.

Also the list of movies were taken from TMDB so it does not truly reflect Netflix catalogue.
